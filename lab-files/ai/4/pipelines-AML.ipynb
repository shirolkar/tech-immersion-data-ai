    "In this experience, you will learn how Contoso Auto can benefit from creating re-usable machine learning pipelines with Azure Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to build a pipeline that demonstrates the basic data science workflow of data preparation, model training, and predictions. Azure Machine Learning allows you to define distinct steps and make it possible to re-use these pipelines as well as to rerun only the steps you need as you tweak and test your workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experience, you will be using a subset of data collected from Contoso Auto's fleet management program used by a fleet of taxis. The data is enriched with holiday and weather data. The goal is to train a regression model to predict taxi fares in New York City based on input features such as, number of passengers, trip distance, datetime, holiday information and weather information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning pipeline in this quickstart is organized into three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preprocess Training and Input Data:** We want to preprocess the data to better represent the datetime features, such as hours of the day, and day of the week to capture the cyclical nature of these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Training:** We will use data transformations and the GradientBoostingRegressor algorithm from the scikit-learn library to train a regression model. The trained model will be saved for later making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Inference:** In this scenario, we want to support **bulk predictions**. Each time an input file is uploaded to a data store, we want to initiate bulk model predictions on the input data. However, before we do model predictions, we will re-use the preprocess data step to process input data, and then make predictions on the processed data using the trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these pipelines is going to have implicit data dependencies and the example will demonstrate how AML make it possible to re-use previously completed steps and run only the modified or new steps in your pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipelines will be run on the Azure Machine Learning compute."
