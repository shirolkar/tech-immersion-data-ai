## Technology overview

Azure Machine Learning service provides a cloud-based environment you can use to prep data, train, test, deploy, manage, and track machine learning models.

![Azure Machine Learning overview](media/intro.png 'Azure Machine Learning overview')

Azure Machine Learning service fully supports open-source technologies. So you can use tens of thousands of open-source Python packages with machine learning components. Examples are PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn. Support for rich tools makes it easy to interactively explore and prepare data and then develop and test models. Examples are [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) or the [Azure Machine Learning for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/itemName/ms-toolsai.vscode-ai/overview) extension.

By using Azure Machine Learning service, you can start training on your local machine and then scale out to the cloud. With many available [compute targets](https://docs.microsoft.com%/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-set-up-training-targets), like Azure Machine Learning Compute and [Azure Databricks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-databricks/what-is-azure-databricks), and with [advanced hyperparameter tuning services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-tune-hyperparameters), you can build better models faster by using the power of the cloud. When you have the right model, you can easily deploy it in a container such as Docker. So it's simple to deploy to Azure Container Instances or Azure Kubernetes Service. Or you can use the container in your own deployments, either on-premises or in the cloud. For more information, see the article on [how to deploy and where](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-deploy-and-where).

You can manage the deployed models and track multiple runs as you experiment to find the best solution. After it's deployed, your model can return predictions in [real time](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-consume-web-service) or [asynchronously](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-run-batch-predictions) on large quantities of data. And with advanced [machine learning pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-ml-pipelines), you can collaborate on all the steps of data preparation, model training and evaluation, and deployment.

Azure Machine Learning service also includes features that [automate model generation and tuning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/tutorial-auto-train-models) to help you create models with ease, efficiency, and accuracy. Automated machine learning is the process of taking training data with a defined target feature, and iterating through combinations of algorithms and feature selections to automatically select the best model for your data based on the training scores. The traditional machine learning model development process is highly resource-intensive, and requires significant domain knowledge and time investment to run and compare the results of dozens of models. Automated machine learning simplifies this process by generating models tuned from the goals and constraints you defined for your experiment, such as the time for the experiment to run or which models to blacklist.

## Scenario overview

In this experience you will learn how the automated machine learning capability in Azure Machine Learning (AML) can be used for the life cycle management of the manufactured vehicles and how AML helps in creation of better vehicle maintenance plans. To accomplish this, you will train a Linear Regression model to predict the number of days until battery failure using Automated Machine Learning in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Exercise 1: Creating a model using automated machine learning

In this exercise, you will create a model that predicts battery failure from time-series data using the visual interface to automated machine learning in an Azure Machine Learning workspace.

### Task 1: Create an automated machine learning experiment using the Portal

1. Navigate to your Azure Machine Learning workspace in the Azure Portal.
2. Select `Automated machine learning` in the left navigation bar.
3. Select **Create Experiment**.

   ![Create new experiment](./media/02_CreateExperiment.png)

4. Provide the experiment name: `automl-regression` and from the drop-down select **gpucluster** and then select **Next**.

   ![Provide experiment name and click on compute](./media/03_NewExperiment_1.png)

5) Now you will upload the training data. Start by downloading the data from https://quickstartsws9073123377.blob.core.windows.net/azureml-blobstore-0d1c4218-a5f9-418b-bf55-902b65277b85/training-formatted.csv. Select **Upload** and then in the dialog that appears choose the file `training-formatted.csv` from your local disk.

   ![Uploading the training data](./media/05_UploadDataFile.png)

6) Select **training-formatted.csv** and review the training data. Be sure to scroll to the right to observe all of the columns in the data.

   ![Reviewing the training data](./media/06_ReviewDataFile.png)

7) Now, you will setup the Auto ML Experiment Basic Settings by providing the following values:

   - Prediction Task: select **Regression**
   - Target column: select **Survival_In_Days**

     ![Setup Auto ML experiment basic settings](./media/07_SetupExp_1.png)

8) Select **Advanced Settings** to expand that area. Provide the following settings:

   - Primary metric: **normalized_root-mean_squared_error**
   - Max number of iterations: **3**
   - Number of Cross Validations: **5**
   - Max concurrent iterations: **1**

     ![Configuring the Advanced Settings as described](./media/08_SetupExp_2.png)

9) Select **Start** to run the experiment and begin automated machine learning process.

### Task 2: Review the experiment run results

1. The experiment will run for about _10 minutes_. Once it completes you should examine the chart to observe the model performance for the primary metric for different iterations.

   ![Review run details - graph view](./media/09_ReviewRunDetails_1.png)

2. Scroll down to see a table view of different iterations and select the iteration with the best **normalized root mean square error** score. Note that the normalized root mean square error measures the error between the predicted value and actual value. In this case, the model with the lowest normalized root mean square error is the best model.

   ![Review run details - table view](./media/010_ReviewRunDetails_2.png)

### Task 3: Register the Best Model

1. Return to the top of the `Run Details` screen and select **Deploy Best Model** as shown. Note that deployment consists of four steps: (1) _Register Best Model_, (2) Download _Scoring and Environment Script files_, (3) Create _Deployment Image_ using the downloaded script files, and (4) Deploy _Scoring Web Service_ using the created image.

   ![The Deploy Best Model button](./media/014_DeployBestModel.png)

2. You register the best model with the Azure Machine Learning model registry so that you can retrieve it later when you want to use it for scoring. Select **Register Model** link. Once the registration process has completed, the link will change to the text `Model has been registered`.

   ![Register Best Model](./media/015_RegisterModel.png)

3. The model registration, will create a new model in your Azure Machine Learning workspace with the same name as the experiment: `automl-regression`. To view this model from the Azure Machine Learning workspace, select **Models**.

   ![Viewing the list of models in the Azure Machine Learning workspace](media/03-automl-registered-model.png)

4. If you see your model in the above list, you are now ready to continue on to the next exercise.
